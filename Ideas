Energy transfer towers project extends to other large steel structures.
Steelbeams compress like springs.  If the force is too great, the spring breaks.
Junctions act under gravity.  Naively, the weight could eb proportional to the number of edges from each node.

Extensions:
	1)	Subject the structure to other forces
	2)	Use Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to optimize for weight and stability.
		The entire network of nodes is a node in the random walk graph for M-H.
		Model the system with that network.  Number of trials that don't fail are a measure of "goodness".
	3)	Model structures with variable gravity. (Extending into space)
